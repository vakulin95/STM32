# STM32 - Workshop 3
## Digital-to-analog and analog-to digital conversion.

### Task

* Configure PA5 as an output pin.
* Measure voltage on PA1 (ADC123_IN1).
* Change voltage using variable resistor and indicate  voltage level using LEDs.
* Configure DAC channel 2 (PA5) and generate signal changing from 0 to MAX and back.

### Info

In this task DAC chanel configured on PA5; and PA4 configured as a simple output pin to generate the highest possible signal.
